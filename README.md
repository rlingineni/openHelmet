## openHelmet
Open Helmet is a way to use the Raspberry Pi to trigger turn-signals on a bicycle helmet. 

Helmet.Py contains the code to be run on the pi. It actually does the calculation. Meter.Py is used to read values from the accelerometer.
Look at the diagrams to see how everything should be hooked up.
